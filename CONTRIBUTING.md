## **THE "HOW TOs" FOR CONTRIBUTION** 

1. This is a fairly simple repository, which consists of files related to a quiz-based Web game for all Potterheads! So if you wanna keep the trivia going, contributions are necessary.
2. You can comment on an issue to get assigned or create an issue and make contributions if you feel the project requires some tweaking. 
3. To begin, fork the repository and clone it as well to keep a change track with the base repository. 
4. Then you can create a branch depending on the number of contributions you wanna make. 
5. Now the common contributions you can make are:-
 
   a. Be a wizard and edit the web-app's look and make it more magical! You can do so by modifying the index.html file. 
   
   b. You can modify the in-game designs so that muggles can also play this game easily.
   
6. Once you have contributed, create a Pull Request with a title clearly describing the contribution and a description of the changes (in short). 

7. There you go, mischief managed!
