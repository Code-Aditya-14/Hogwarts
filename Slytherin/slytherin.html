            <h2>Traits
            </h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Ambition</h3>
                    <p>A trait that nearly all Slytherins have in common is ambition. They want to be the best: the
                        smartest in the class, the most popular in a group of friends, the boss at work. Because of
                        their strong drive and work ethic, they often achieve these heights, too, becoming invaluable
                        members of society and powerful in the work world.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Cunning</h3>
                    <p>Slytherins are highly intelligent, but not in the same way as Ravenclaws. Rather than seeking to
                        expand their knowledge, Slytherins simply find ways to use their existing skills to their
                        advantage. This makes them clever and cunning and can aid them in their quest for fame and
                        power.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Resourcefulness</h3>
                    <p>Slytherins are able to make the best of any situation. They're highly adaptable and resourceful
                        and can find ways to turn even the worst situations to their advantage.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <h3>Determination</h3>
                    <p>Like Hufflepuffs, Slytherins are highly determined. Their determination, however, is more
                        self-focused. They will use their strong work ethic to fulfill their ambition and advance their
                        own position. While this may seem self-absorbed, Slytherins recognise that by focusing on
                        self-improvement, they can become better friends and family members and be more useful to
                        society as a whole.</p>

            <h2>Salazar Slytherin

            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Professor Salazar Slytherin was a pure-blood wizard of medieval times. He was a Parselmouth (a wizard with the rare ability to speak with snakes) and skilled at Legilimency.He was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the former best friend of Godric Gryffindor, a fellow founder. Slytherin didn't trust Muggle-born students, and he expressed his opinion not to accept them at Hogwarts. However, when the other Hogwarts founders didn't agree, Slytherin left the school and did not return again but not before creating the Chamber of Secrets and concealing a basilisk inside. He died sometime in the Middle Ages.</p>
